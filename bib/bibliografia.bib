	abstract = { The tertiary structures of 43 proteins selected so as to cover the five structural classes of protein molecule are analyzed with a geometrical theory called fractal theory with the intention of devising a new tool for quantitative description of the tertiary structure of protein. A brief introduction to the fractal theory is given in the text. It is demonstrated that the principles dictating the folding of the local backbone structure and the global backbone structure are well characterized in terms of the representation of the fractal theory. Comparison of the fractal character of protein molecules with that of the ideal Gaussian chain revealed several characters of these principles. It is also shown that the proteins in the structural class of β type are distinguished quantitatively from other classes with this representation. A curious discovery that several proteins take the fractal dimension greater than two is reported and discussed. }

The surface fractal dimensions calculated by the variation method are different from those obtained by other methods, since the former is applicable to the self-affine system. Thus the results reported here are reliable for the surfaces. However, the fat fractal and multifractal features of proteins and enzymes are studied by simulation. The surface mass exponents are regarded as another kind of scaling exponent, and the spectrum f (α) provides further detailed information about the surfaces of enzyme and protein. The applications of the spectrum f (α) to the enzymatic reactions is also discussed.}

	ABSTRACT = {The geometry of cavities in the surfaces of proteins facilitates a variety of biochemical functions. To better understand the biochemical nature of protein cavities, the shape, size, chemical properties, and evolutionary nature of functional and nonfunctional surface cavities have been exhaustively surveyed in protein structures. The rigidity of surface cavities, however, is not immediately available as a characteristic of structure data, and is thus more difficult to examine. Using rigidity analysis for assessing and analyzing molecular rigidity, this paper performs the first survey of the relationships between cavity properties, such as size and residue content, and how they correspond to cavity rigidity. Our survey measured a variety of rigidity metrics on 120,323 cavities from 12,785 sequentially non-redundant protein chains. We used VASP-E, a volume-based algorithm for analyzing cavity geometry. Our results suggest that rigidity properties of protein cavities are dependent on cavity surface area.},

Non-specific and non-covalent interactions between amino acids exhibit neighborhood preferences. Based on structural information from the protein data bank, a statistical energy function was derived to quantify amino acid neighborhood preferences. The neighborhood of one amino acid is defined by its contacting residues, and the energy function is determined by the neighboring residue types and relative positions. The neighborhood preference of amino acids was exploited to facilitate structural quality assessment, which was implemented in the neighborhood preference program NEPRE.
