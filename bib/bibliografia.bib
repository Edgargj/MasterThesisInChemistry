ABSTRACT = {The geometry of cavities in the surfaces of proteins facilitates a variety of biochemical functions. To better understand the biochemical nature of protein cavities, the shape, size, chemical properties, and evolutionary nature of functional and nonfunctional surface cavities have been exhaustively surveyed in protein structures. The rigidity of surface cavities, however, is not immediately available as a characteristic of structure data, and is thus more difficult to examine. Using rigidity analysis for assessing and analyzing molecular rigidity, this paper performs the first survey of the relationships between cavity properties, such as size and residue content, and how they correspond to cavity rigidity. Our survey measured a variety of rigidity metrics on 120,323 cavities from 12,785 sequentially non-redundant protein chains. We used VASP-E, a volume-based algorithm for analyzing cavity geometry. Our results suggest that rigidity properties of protein cavities are dependent on cavity surface area.},

	abstract  = {Amino acids form protein 3D structures in unique manners such that the folded structure is stable and functional under physiological conditions. Non-specific and non-covalent interactions between amino acids exhibit neighborhood preferences. Based on structural information from the protein data bank, a statistical energy function was derived to quantify amino acid neighborhood preferences. The neighborhood of one amino acid is defined by its contacting residues, and the energy function is determined by the neighboring residue types and relative positions. The neighborhood preference of amino acids was exploited to facilitate structural quality assessment, which was implemented in the neighborhood preference program NEPRE. The source codes are available via https://github.com/LiuLab-CSRC/NePre.}
