A brief introduction to the fractal theory is given in the text. It is demonstrated that the principles dictating the folding of the local backbone structure and the global backbone structure are well characterized in terms of the representation of the fractal theory. Comparison of the fractal character of protein molecules with that of the ideal Gaussian chain revealed several characters of these principles. It is also shown that the proteins in the structural class of β type are distinguished quantitatively from other classes with this representation. A curious discovery that several proteins take the fractal dimension greater than two is reported and discussed. }

Thus the results reported here are reliable for the surfaces. However, the fat fractal and multifractal features of proteins and enzymes are studied by simulation. The surface mass exponents are regarded as another kind of scaling exponent, and the spectrum f (α) provides further detailed information about the surfaces of enzyme and protein. The applications of the spectrum f (α) to the enzymatic reactions is also discussed.}

	abstract = {Year 2010 marked the 25th year since we came to know that roughness of a protein surface has fractal symmetry. Ever since the publication of Lewis and Rees' paper, hundreds of works from a spectrum of perspectives have established that fractal dimension (FD) can be considered as a reliable marker that describes roughness of protein surface objectively. In this article, we introduce readers to the fundamentals of fractals and present categorical biophysical and geometrical reasons as to why FD-based constructs can describe protein surface roughness more accurately. We then review the commonality (and the lack of it) between numerous approaches that have attempted to investigate protein surface with fractal measures, before exploring the patterns in the results that they have produced. Apart from presenting the genealogy of approaches and results, we present an analysis that quantifies the difference in surface roughness in stretches of protein surface containing the active site, before and after binding to ligands, to underline the utility of FD-based measures further. It has been found that surface stretches containing the active site, in general, undergo a significant increment in its roughness after binding. After presenting the entire repertoire of FD-based surface roughness studies, we talk about two yet-unexplored problems where application of FD-based techniques can help in deciphering underlying patterns of surface interactions. Finally, we list the limitations of FD-based constructs and put down several precautions that one must take while working with them. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	ABSTRACT = {The geometry of cavities in the surfaces of proteins facilitates a variety of biochemical functions. To better understand the biochemical nature of protein cavities, the shape, size, chemical properties, and evolutionary nature of functional and nonfunctional surface cavities have been exhaustively surveyed in protein structures. The rigidity of surface cavities, however, is not immediately available as a characteristic of structure data, and is thus more difficult to examine. Using rigidity analysis for assessing and analyzing molecular rigidity, this paper performs the first survey of the relationships between cavity properties, such as size and residue content, and how they correspond to cavity rigidity. Our survey measured a variety of rigidity metrics on 120,323 cavities from 12,785 sequentially non-redundant protein chains. We used VASP-E, a volume-based algorithm for analyzing cavity geometry. Our results suggest that rigidity properties of protein cavities are dependent on cavity surface area.},

The neighborhood of one amino acid is defined by its contacting residues, and the energy function is determined by the neighboring residue types and relative positions. The neighborhood preference of amino acids was exploited to facilitate structural quality assessment, which was implemented in the neighborhood preference program NEPRE.

	ABSTRACT = {This study analyzes the fractal aspects of the structures of S100 proteins to better understand their structural complexity. We take into account 33 solution structures and 18 crystal structures corresponding to human S100 proteins for the calculation of mass and surface fractal dimensions. The mass fractal dimension value is calculated as Dm = 1.54, confirming the extended conformation of the dimers of these proteins. The mean value of the surface fractal dimension is Ds = 2.35 ± 0.09 when computed using solution structures and Ds = 2.23 ± 0.05 when computed using crystal structures, revealing the surface irregularities of S100 proteins. Changes in surface fractal dimensions have been recorded for S100 proteins due to the changes in the pH of the environment, due to mutations in their sequences that alter how the protein folds, and/or due to their interactions with ions and/or ligands that reflect the structural rearrangements that occur upon binding. These changes can significantly influence the biological activity of the protein, making the fractal dimension of the surface a valuable parameter in studying protein functions, interactions, and potential therapeutic targeting.},

	abstract  = {The application of fractal dimension-based constructs to probe the protein interior dates back to the development of the concept of fractal dimension itself. Numerous approaches have been tried and tested over a course of (almost) 30 years with the aim of elucidating the various facets of symmetry of self-similarity prevalent in the protein interior. In the last 5 years especially, there has been a startling upsurge of research that innovatively stretches the limits of fractal-based studies to present an array of unexpected results on the biophysical properties of protein interior. In this article, we introduce readers to the fundamentals of fractals, reviewing the commonality (and the lack of it) between these approaches before exploring the patterns in the results that they produced. Clustering the approaches in major schools of protein self-similarity studies, we describe the evolution of fractal dimension-based methodologies. The genealogy of approaches (and results) presented here portrays a clear picture of the contemporary state of fractal-based studies in the context of the protein interior. To underline the utility of fractal dimension-based measures further, we have performed a correlation dimension analysis on all of the available non-redundant protein structures, both at the level of an individual protein and at the level of structural domains. In this investigation, we were able to separately quantify the self-similar symmetries in spatial correlation patterns amongst peptide–dipole units, charged amino acids, residues with the π-electron cloud and hydrophobic amino acids. The results revealed that electrostatic environments in the interiors of proteins belonging to ‘α/α toroid’ (all-α class) and ‘PLP-dependent transferase-like’ domains (α/β class) are highly conducive. In contrast, the interiors of ‘zinc finger design’ (‘designed proteins’) and ‘knottins’ (‘small proteins’) were identified as folds with the least conducive electrostatic environments. The fold ‘conotoxins’ (peptides) could be unambiguously identified as one type with the least stability. The same analyses revealed that peptide–dipoles in the α/β class of proteins, in general, are more correlated to each other than are the peptide–dipoles in proteins belonging to the all-α class. Highly favorable electrostatic milieu in the interiors of TIM-barrel, α/β-hydrolase structures could explain their remarkably conserved (evolutionary) stability from a new light. Finally, we point out certain inherent limitations of fractal constructs before attempting to identify the areas and problems where the implementation of fractal dimension-based constructs can be of paramount help to unearth latent information on protein structural properties.}

	ABSTRACT = {This study analyzes the fractal aspects of the structures of S100 proteins to better understand their structural complexity. We take into account 33 solution structures and 18 crystal structures corresponding to human S100 proteins for the calculation of mass and surface fractal dimensions. The mass fractal dimension value is calculated as Dm = 1.54, confirming the extended conformation of the dimers of these proteins. The mean value of the surface fractal dimension is Ds = 2.35 ± 0.09 when computed using solution structures and Ds = 2.23 ± 0.05 when computed using crystal structures, revealing the surface irregularities of S100 proteins. Changes in surface fractal dimensions have been recorded for S100 proteins due to the changes in the pH of the environment, due to mutations in their sequences that alter how the protein folds, and/or due to their interactions with ions and/or ligands that reflect the structural rearrangements that occur upon binding. These changes can significantly influence the biological activity of the protein, making the fractal dimension of the surface a valuable parameter in studying protein functions, interactions, and potential therapeutic targeting.},

For a large class of single domain proteins, we computed the harmonic spectrum within the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and determined their spectral dimension, a parameter describing the low frequency behavior of the density of modes. We found a surprisingly strong correlation between the spectral dimension and the number of amino acids in the protein. Considering that larger spectral dimension values relate to more topologically compact folded states, our results indicate that, for a given temperature and length of protein, the folded structure corresponds to a less compact folding, one compatible with thermodynamic stability.},

	abstract = { Proteins have well-defined three dimensional structures which are dictated by their amino acid sequence. Despite this great specificity, general structural and dynamic properties exist. Scaling relationships for the radius of gyration and surface area of a large data set of proteins are demonstrated in this work. These results show that proteins scale as collapsed polymers. Thermal fluctuations are examined for two different proteins by an analysis of the Debye-Waller factors derived from X-ray crystallographic data. Long-range correlations exist between fluctuations along the backbone. A disordered Ising model is presented which gives similar correlations. To further examine the role of multiple connectivity in protein structures, the vibrational spectrum for an alpha helix (linear chain with H-bonds) is analyzed from recursive relationships derived using a decimation technique. }

	abstract  = {Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) participate in nearly all microtubule-based cellular processes and have recently been proposed to function as liquid condensates. However, their formation and internal organization remain poorly understood. Here, we have study the phase separation of Bik1, a CLIP-170 family member and key +TIP involved in budding yeast cell division. Bik1 is a dimer with a rod-shaped conformation primarily defined by its central coiled-coil domain. Its liquid condensation likely involves the formation of higher-order oligomers that phase separate in a manner dependent on the protein’s N-terminal CAP-Gly domain and C-terminal EEY/F-like motif. This process is accompanied by conformational rearrangements in Bik1, leading to at least a two-fold increase in multivalent interactions between its folded and disordered domains. Unlike classical liquids, Bik1 condensates exhibit a heterogeneous, fractal supramolecular structure with protein- and solvent-rich regions. This structural evidence supports recent percolation-based models of biomolecular condensates. Together, our findings offer insights into the structure, dynamic rearrangement, and organization of a complex, oligomeric, and multidomain protein in both dilute and condensed states. Our experimental framework can be applied to other biomolecular condensates, including more complex +TIP networks.}

	abstract = {Fractal geometry analysis provides a useful and desirable tool to characterize the configuration and structure of proteins. In this paper we examined the fractal properties of 750 folded proteins from four different structural classes, namely (1) the α-class (dominated by α-helices), (2) the β-class (dominated by β-pleated sheets), (3) the (α/β)-class (α-helices and β-sheets alternately mixed) and (4) the (α+β)-class (α-helices and β-sheets largely segregated) by using two fractal dimension methods, i.e. “the local fractal dimension” and “the backbone fractal dimension” (a new and useful quantitative parameter). The results showed that the protein molecules exhibit a fractal behavior in the range of 1⩽N⩽15 (N is the number of the interval between two adjacent amino acid residues), and the value of backbone fractal dimension is distinctly greater than that of local fractal dimension for the same protein. The average value of two fractal dimensions decreased in order of α>α/β>α+β>β. Moreover, the mathematical formula for the hybrid orbital model of protein based on the concept of backbone fractal dimension is in good coincidence with that of the similarity dimension. So it is a very accurate and simple method to analyze the hybrid orbital model of protein by using the backbone fractal dimension.}
